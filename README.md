where $\alpha=1,2$ refers to the quantum dots and $i=L,R$ to the electron reservoirs. 

The spectral function of the system $A=-\sum_{\alpha}\text{Im}\[G_\alpha(\omega)\]/\pi$, the local occupations $n_{\alpha}$, the density correlators $\braket{n_\alpha\ldots n_{\alpha}}$, as well as the  charge  and heat currents I and Q are analytically calculated for a given out-of-equilibrium working configuration set by the parameters $T,\gamma$, the external gates $\varepsilon_\alpha$, the bias voltage $V$, the thermal gradient $\Delta T=T_L-R_R$ and the Coulombic interactions $U_\alpha$ and $U_{12}$.
